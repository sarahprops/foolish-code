# Fool.com Front End Developer Test Project

Hello potential Fool!  We’d love to give you the chance to show off your skills!  We want to see how you would create and design a keyword "hub page" for Fool.com.
Along with your technical skills we're hoping to gain better insight into how you communicate with team members, ask for help when necessary, take instruction, and solve problems.
This is your chance to demonstrate skills beyond what we can see from your resume and from a talking-only interview.

If you are familiar with all the technologies we are requesting that you use for this challenge, we estimate it will take around **10-15 hours to complete**.
If you are learning some of these particular tools for the first time, it may take you longer, and that’s OK!
Just keep us in the loop as to how things are going.  Feel free to spend more time on it if you are on a roll and can’t stop the awesome!



## What are we looking for:
* Professional development work (clean code, well-organized, appropriate comments, integration tests where necessary, no loose ends, no sloppy spelling, no browser console errors).
* Creative problem solving on the technical side and for user enjoyment
* Solid analytical approach - are you solving the business problem, or just writing code?
* Good communication with us as you are working on the project, so we can get a feel for what it would be like to work with you!
* Please change anything you would like including entire layout, fonts, image/text sizing, or anything else you feel will make this page attractive to our target market.
  - Styles and Scripts can go in `/static/` directory



## The Challenge
One of our stakeholders would like to create a new webpage on our site. The business goal is to have keyword hub pages on our website that are associated with commonly searched keywords from organic traffic.
